Working on Linux and Windows.

This application is created for making reports from sql databases. It must be started from command line and requires 4 arguments.
- database engine (oracle, postgres).
- database addres / name.
- user name.
- password.

After the application command has been executed one can write various queries, for which results will be generated in the 
txt file (the report). The raport file will be named as "data of executed query" and can be found in the application folder.

Connection examples:

- java Switch postgres //dbaddres/dbname user password
- java Switch oracle dbaddres:port/sid user password
